# Cloud-Project
This project introduces a secure file upload and download system in a multi-tenant cloud setup:
AES encryption for file security B-crypt for password hashing Supabase as a backend for storage and authentication. Each tenant has their own isolated space, and files are encrypted before being uploaded, and decrypted during download using a secret key. The system is scalable and suitable for industries like healthcare, finance, and e-commerce.
